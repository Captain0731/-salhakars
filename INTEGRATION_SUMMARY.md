### 4. Routing Updates (✅ Completed)
Updated `src/App.js` with new routing structure:

  - `/` - Landing Page
  - `/login` - Login/Signup Page

- **Protected Routes** (with sidebar):
  - `/dashboard` - Main Dashboard
  - `/home` - Home Page
  - `/judgments` - Judgments Access
  - `/all-judgments` - All Judgments (with filters)
  - `/judgment/:cnr` - Individual Judgment Details
  - `/library` - Legal Reference Library
  - `/mapping` - Old to New Law Mapping
  - `/templates` - Legal Document Templates

### 5. Navigation Flow
```

## How to Use

### Starting the Application
```bash
cd /home/aditya/Downloads/AGL/salhakar
npm start
```

1. **First Visit**: User lands on the beautiful landing page at `/`
2. **Browse Features**: User can explore what the platform offers
3. **Login**: Click "Login" button to go to `/login`
4. **Sign Up/Sign In**: New users sign up, existing users sign in
5. **Dashboard**: After login, redirected to `/dashboard` with full sidebar navigation
6. **Features Access**: Access all features through sidebar or direct links

## Technical Features
- React Router v6 for navigation

- Form validation (email regex, password strength)
- Conditional rendering (sidebar visibility)
- Component reusability
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Add authentication context/state management
- [ ] Implement protected routes with auth guards
- [ ] Connect to actual backend API for login/signup
- [ ] Add JWT token storage and management
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Social login (Google, Facebook)
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Session timeout handling

## Notes
- Login form currently redirects to `/dashboard` for demo purposes
- Backend API endpoints are placeholders (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`)
- You can implement actual authentication by updating the fetch calls in `Login.jsx`
- The search functionality navigates to `/all-judgments` with query parameters

## Original Folders (Can be deleted if desired)
- `salhakar_landing/` - Original landing page React app (now integrated)
- `slahakar log sign/` - Original HTML/CSS/JS login page (now converted to React)

These folders are no longer needed as all functionality has been integrated into the main `src/` directory.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Infinite Scroll
```javascript
// Uses IntersectionObserver for performance
- Observer watches a ref element at bottom of list
- Triggers fetch when element enters viewport
- 100px margin for smooth preloading
- Prevents multiple simultaneous fetches
- Clean unmount handling
```

### Date Filters
```javascript
// HTML5 date inputs for native calendar
- from_date: Start date of judgment search
- to_date: End date of judgment search
- Easy to use, mobile-friendly
- Native validation
```

### Auto-redirect
```javascript
// JudgmentsAccess → All Judgments
- useEffect hook for immediate redirect
- Shows loading state during transition
- Clean user experience
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Design
All changes maintain full responsiveness:
- ✅ Mobile-friendly date pickers
- ✅ Infinite scroll works on touch devices
- ✅ Logo scales properly
- ✅ Filter grid adapts to screen size

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations
1. **useCallback** for fetch function (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
2. **IntersectionObserver** for scroll detection (better than scroll events)
3. **Smart loading states** (only shows spinner for initial load)
4. **Ref-based observer** (no memory leaks)
